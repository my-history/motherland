# Моя Родина

## О проекте

Моя Родина – социальная сеть для людей, которые хотят изучить и сохранить свою историю.

## История развития

I did a little testing among completely random people on questions related to the history of their native land.

Unfortunately, it showed very bad results. People not interested in their history. Look at the Ukraine: they try to change OUR history because Russians are "agrressors". What?! Is it normal? I think we are brothers and should be together.



It's no secret that modern human spends a lot of time for the Internet.

Hence the clear goal that this project should solve - it should be a social network with a huge amount of local history material about all regions of Russia. Everyone will be able to add their own material, thereby developing the project.

It turns out that a person solves two needs at once: communicates with other people and self-develops.



Of course, such big plans did not appear immediately from the beginning of development.

Initially, it was a small school project that was made “to get behind”. But I quickly realized that I had chosen a very interesting topic and decided to continue development after the project was completed.



The project participated in various competitions several times, and even somewhere won prizes.



During development, I put all my heart into the project and I hope you will appreciate it.
