# Motherland

## About

Motherland — educational historical website, developing for improving knowledge of Russians about their history. About peoples, who made parts of our motherland so unique, about buildings and memorials, what wanna see peoples all around the world, about smallest streets, and about how WWII changed life all of the country.

## History

I did a little testing among completely random people on questions related to the history of their native land.
Unfortunately, it showed very bad results.
It's no secret that modern man spends a lot of time for the Internet.
Hence the clear goal that this project should solve - it should be a social network with a huge amount of local history material about all regions of Russia, and not anyhow, but well structured by headings. Everyone will be able to add their own material, thereby developing the project.
It turns out that a person solves two needs at once: communicates with other people and self-develops.

Of course, such big plans did not appear immediately from the beginning of development.
Initially, it was a small school project that was made “to get behind”. But I quickly realized that I had chosen a very interesting topic and decided to continue development after the project was completed.

The project participated in various competitions several times, and even somewhere won prizes.

During development, I put all my heart into the project and I hope you will appreciate it.
